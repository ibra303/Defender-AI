# Defender-AI
Defender-AI is software designed for monitoring motion in a user's environment and providing alerts through a Telegram bot chat.

Road Map :

Done:

Motion Detection: Defender-AI likely includes a motion detection mechanism using sensors or cameras. This could involve computer vision algorithms to analyze video feeds for any significant changes.

Alert Generation: When motion is detected, the software generates alerts. These alerts can be triggered based on predefined criteria, such as the intensity or duration of the detected motion.

Integration with Telegram: The alerts are sent to the user through a Telegram bot chat. This integration enables real-time communication and notifications directly to the user's Telegram account.

User Configuration: Users may have the ability to configure the sensitivity of motion detection, set alert thresholds, or customize other parameters based on their preferences and the specific     characteristics of their environment.

  Future Modification:
      
Logging and History: Defender-AI might keep a log of motion events and alerts, allowing users to review historical data to identify patterns or investigate specific incidents.

Security Measures: To ensure the integrity and security of the system, Defender-AI may implement encryption and authentication mechanisms, preventing unauthorized access or tampering.

Remote Access: Depending on the design, users may have the ability to remotely access the system, view live feeds, or manage settings through the Telegram bot interface.
